# Fakenews-Avoiding-Game
A point based games for avoiding fake news. You can get points by reviewing articles, uploads from other users. More knowledge - less fake news
We all know fake news are painful. Build a game. For each text you write and plan to publish you assign a buddy. This buddy has to make sure that you indeed have written something that does not seem like fake news. If your buddy completes the review, both of you get points. Add the fake news review score to the post. You can, of course, think about other ways how to incentivize writing and reviewing.
